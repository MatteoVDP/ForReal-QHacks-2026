Pitch: Misinformation is everywhere, and is so easy to come by and just pass by. There is currently no very easy and verifiable way to quickly check if things are true or not, something that is as simple as looking at the misinformation itself.

Functionality (high level):
    - Magnifying glass next to the media (super accessible), that when clicks checks if a piece of media is fact or not.

Outputs:
    - A clear ground truth source link
        - Could include the direct quote
    - A label (true, false, misleading, unverifiable)
        - Alternatively, could put a confidence level based on our instructions (if they found the exact words, is the source a reliable one, etc.)
    - A bias checker
        - Maybe do a sentiment analysis on the actual paper (might not be feasible)
    - A brief (1-2 sentence explanation)

Platforms:
    - X (THIS IS THE CORE)
    - LinkedIn (professional misinformation)
    - Reddit
    Nice to have:
        - Wikipedia

Minimum Viable Product:
    - X is the first platform we want to do
    - Magnifying glass next to the media (like next to the like, share, etc. buttons on the website) (super accessible), that when clicked checks if a piece of media is fact or not.
        Outputs:
        - A ground truth source link
        - A label (true, false, misleading, unverifiable)
        - A brief (1-2 sentence explanation)
